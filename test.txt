An alumni app serves as a bridge between past and present students, fostering a strong and connected community.
It provides a platform where alumni can reconnect with former classmates,
mentor current students, and explore career opportunities through job and internship postings.
Features such as a searchable alumni directory, event updates, discussion forums, and location-based
networking help users stay engaged. Additionally, the app facilitates direct communication
through messaging and video calls, making it easier for alumni to contribute to their alma mater.
By strengthening professional and social connections, an alumni app enhances networking,
collaboration, and the overall sense of belonging within the institutionâ€™s extended community.
